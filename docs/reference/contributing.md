# Contributing

We welcome contributions to the Sayou Data Fabric! Whether you're fixing a bug, proposing a new feature, or improving documentation, your help is valued.

## Ways to Contribute

* **Issues:** Report bugs, request new features, or ask questions. Please check if a similar issue already exists before creating a new one.
* **Pull Requests (PRs):** Submit your changes to the codebase.

## Pull Request Workflow

We follow the Git Strategy outlined in the main `README.md`. All contributions must be made via Pull Requests to the `develop` branch.

1.  **Fork** the `sayou-fabric` repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone** your fork to your local machine.
3.  **Create a branch** from `develop`. Use the `feature/` or `fix/` prefix (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/add-new-fetcher`).
4.  **Make your changes.**
5.  **Add Tests:** (Placeholder for text: "If you are adding a new feature or fixing a bug, please add corresponding unit tests under the `tests/` directory for that package.")
6.  **Update Documentation:** (Placeholder for text: "If your change affects behavior, please update the relevant `.md` file in the `docs/library-guides/` folder.")
7.  **Run Linters/Formatters:** (Placeholder for text: "Please run `black .` and `ruff .` to format your code before committing.")
8.  **Commit** your changes with a conventional commit message (e.g., `feat(connector): Add S3Fetcher T3 plugin`).
9.  **Push** your branch to your fork.
10. **Open a Pull Request** from your branch to the `sayou-fabric:develop` branch.
