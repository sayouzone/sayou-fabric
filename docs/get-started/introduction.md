# Introduction

**Sayou Data Platform** is a modular open-source framework designed to streamline the development of production-grade LLM data pipelines.

---

## 1. Motivation

Modern LLM applications require complex data operations — ingestion, preprocessing, retrieval, and generation — each with its own context and scaling requirements.

Sayou Data Platform provides a unified, interface-driven ecosystem that supports explicit data flow control across all stages of the pipeline.

## 2. Typical Use Cases

- Data pipeline orchestration for RAG systems
- Preprocessing and enrichment for enterprise data lakes
- Modular knowledge graph or document indexing systems
- Hybrid local/remote LLM integration pipelines
