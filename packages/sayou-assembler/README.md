## 💡 Why Sayou Assembler?

`sayou_assembler` transforms refined atoms into graph or vector representations.  
It enforces ontology constraints, manages schemas, and stores the outputs.

- **Ontology-Driven:** Schema-based validation before storing.  
- **Flexible Storage:** JSON, Neo4j, or vector stores.  
- **Extensible Builders:** Create your own KG logic easily.
